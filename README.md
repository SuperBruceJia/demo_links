### [1. ridll.com](http://ridll.com) ###
**RIDLL** standards for Richard Xu's Deep Learning Lab: This Cloud based demo website has about nine research demos works by my team since 2016. Some notable examples include:  
* [Automatic word-completion tool for writing Job Descriptions](http://ridll.com/jobgenerator/) completed in 2016 by my team (it takes about 30 seconds to load)
* [Visualization for What-If scenarios for sydney train networks](http://ridll.com/foresight/) click a moving train to bring up a timetable to create a what-if scenario - it also support multi-screen-tasking, completed in 2017 by my team
* [Interface for the shortest maitanaince plan using TSM algorithm](http://ridll.com/activequery/) completed in 2020 by my team
* [Natural Language to SQL Translation](http://ridll.com/nlp2sql/) completed in 2016 by my team

### [2. List of Funded Contractural Research Projects](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu/grants) ###
This is my official UTS website which shows all the projects that I am the first Chief Investigator since 2015. The funded project names are extracted from the UTS Grants database. Include, *Transport for NSW, Sydney Trains, NSW DFSI, CSIRO, Ausgrid, CCH Australia, DSTG, Office of Naval Research, NSW DPI,Food Agility CRC*. In addition, two Australian companies requested not to list the project name due to commercial confidence.

### [3. Leadership in 900K Newcrest Mining project](https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2930594/AR08.pdf) ###
This is link to the Charles Sturt University's annual 2008 report, it contains the following paragraph:  
*Dr Richard Xu, a lecturer in computer science at the School of Accounting and Computer Science, has begun leading a three-year project to develop a truck-mounted prototype with video camera, sonar and radar to automate a mining process when large rocks jam the rock crusher. The device could prevent costly shutdowns of plant. Newcrest Mines provided $900,000 to fund the project.*

I was only a 30-year-old lecturer at the time, and I became responsible for a huge industry research team composed of associate professors!

### [4. World Champian in IEEE Games Micro-RTS competition](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/competition-results/2019-cog-results) ###
In 2019, my postdoctoral fellow Dr. Jason Traish and I led the winning of the IEEE Confernece on Game's Micro-RTS competition.

### 5. My computer vision Demos in YouTube###
Between 2004 to 2009, I have built at least 20 different AI systems based on computer vision at CSU. In addition to being a researcher, I am also an excellent engineer. I built most of these systems myself, including the hard work of installing the cameras. Please note that I have uploaded these video demos to YouTube at different times. I did not try to centralize them. Here are the links to these video channels:

* [YouTube Demo Channel one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-k-IImevvnN1J6fYhJMA4Q), circa 2005-2009, six demo systems. 
* [YouTube Demo Channel two](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6U2WWd9xHebIpwCkGDZLkg), these two channel may have overlaping videos
* [My TV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYnRuWAaw), a TV news team came to interview me to talk about my computer vision work in 2009.


These are some famous examples:

### 6. My student's computer vision Demos in YouTube###
Fortunately, since 2017, I finally have a laboratory space at UTS to continue computer vision. These are some examples of resume work for my postdoctoral and PhD students:

* [My lab team's video demo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLPFBeNlA0arPTrCor3tTg), circa 2017-2009
* [Marker less mulitple people tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ivo10gvUo), my student's work, published in ECCV 2020.
