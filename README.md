**RIDLL** standards for Richard Xu's Deep Learning Lab: This Cloud based demo website has about collections of 9 of my engineers/students research demos works since 2016. Some notable examples include:  
* [Automatic word-completion for Job Descriptions](http://ridll.com/jobgenerator/)  
* [Visualization for What-If scenarios for sydney train networks](http://ridll.com/foresight/) click a moving train to bring up a timetable to create a what-if scenario - it also support multi-screen-tasking
* [Natural Language to SQL Translation](http://ridll.com/nlp2sql/)  

### [List of Funded Contractural Research Projects](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu/grants) ###
This is my official UTS website which shows all the projects that I am the first Chief Investigator since 2015. The funded project names are extracted from the UTS Grants database. In addition, two Australian companies requested not to list the project name due to commercial confidence.

### [Leadership in 900K Newcrest Mining project](https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2930594/AR08.pdf) ###
This is the Charles Sturt University's annual 2008 report, and you search through this pdf by my name "Richard Xu", you will find the following paragraph:   
*Dr Richard Xu, a lecturer in computer science at the School of Accounting and Computer Science, has begun leading a three-year project to develop a truck-mounted prototype with video camera, sonar and radar to automate a mining process when large rocks jam the rock crusher. The device could prevent costly shutdowns of plant. Newcrest Mines provided $900,000 to fund the project.*  
I am only a 30-year-old lecturer at the time, and I became responsible for a huge industry research team composed of associate professors!
