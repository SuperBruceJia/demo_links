In the past 15 years, my talented team and I have developed many research and engineering prototypes, demos, research notes and commercial projects. Because of such a long time span, our digital footprint is all over the Web. Therefore, I organized them into a single repository:

### [1. Cloud demo: ridll.com](http://ridll.com) ###
**RIDLL** is an acronym for **Ri**chard Xu's **D**eep **L**earning **L**ab: This Cloud based demo website has about nine research demos developed by my talented team since 2016. Some notable examples include:  
* [Visualization for What-If scenarios planning for sydney train networks](http://ridll.com/foresight/) The number in the circle represents the estimated number of people on the train using our prediction algorithm based on tap-on/tap-off information alone. Click a moving train to bring up a timetable to create a what-if scenario - it also support multi-screen-tasking, completed in 2017. (Note all the data are synthetically generated)
* [Automatic word-completion tool for writing Job Descriptions](http://ridll.com/jobgenerator/) the language model was trained using job description data. Completed in 2016. (it may take about 30 seconds to load)
* [Web Tool for optimal maintenance planning using TSM algorithm](http://ridll.com/activequery/) a software tool (complete with web interface) to compute the most cost effective maintenance schedule using Travelling Salesman's Algorithm. Completed in 2020.
* [Natural Language to SQL Translation](http://ridll.com/nlp2sql/) completed in 2016.

### [2. List of Funded Industry Contractural Research Projects](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu/grants) ###
This is my official UTS website which shows all the projects that I am the first Chief Investigator since 2015. The funded project names are extracted from the UTS Grants database. My research partners include, *Transport for NSW, Sydney Trains, NSW DFSI, Magellan financial group, CSIRO, Ausgrid, CCH Australia, DSTG, Office of Naval Research, NSW DPI,Food Agility CRC (with Dairy Australia, Coles, USYD, CSU and DataGene)*. In addition, two Australian companies requested not to list the company & project name due to commercial confidence.

### [3. Lead $900K Newcrest Mining project](https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2930594/AR08.pdf) ###
When I was 30, working at Charles Sturt University as a lectuer in 2008, I became in charge of a large industry research team composed of senior lecturers and even associate professors! This is a link to the 2008 annual report from CSU, which contains the following paragraph:
#### *Dr Richard Xu, a lecturer in computer science at the School of Accounting and Computer Science, has begun leading a three-year project to develop a truck-mounted prototype with video camera, sonar and radar to automate a mining process when large rocks jam the rock crusher. The device could prevent costly shutdowns of plant. Newcrest Mines provided $900,000 to fund the project.* ####

### [4. World Champion in IEEE Games Conference's Micro-RTS competition](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/competition-results/2019-cog-results) ###
In 2019, my postdoctoral fellow Dr. Jason Traish led a team of my PhD students to win the IEEE Games Conference's Micro-RTS competition. Our Reinforcement Learning based AI bot, **UTS_Imass** has a significantly higher win rate compare to the second best team. 
You can visit the official website of IEEE Games Conference [https://ieee-cog.org/2019/competitions_conference/](https://ieee-cog.org/2019/competitions_conference/) then click the "Competition Site" link to browse the above Goolge document in the same way.

### 5. My computer vision Demos in YouTube ###
Between 2006 to 2009, I have built at least a dozen state-of-the-art AI systems based on computer vision at CSU. In addition to being a researcher, I am also an excellent engineer. I built most of these systems myself, including research, coding, purchasing, and even the hard carpentary work of installing the cameras. Here are the links to my video demo channels:

* [YouTube Demo Channel one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-k-IImevvnN1J6fYhJMA4Q) and [YouTube Demo Channel two](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6U2WWd9xHebIpwCkGDZLkg), circa 2005-2009, contains nine demo systems. including PTZ camera control, face tracking, augmented reality, automated whiteboard capturing, body pose tracking, etc. Note that these two channels have overlaping videos.
* [My TV Interview with Prime TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYnRuWAaw), Prime TV news team came to interview me at CSU to talk about my computer vision work in 2009.

### 6. My student's computer vision Demos in YouTube ###
Fortunately, since 2017, I finally have a laboratory space at UTS to continue computer vision. These are some examples of resume work for my postdoctoral and PhD students:

* [My lab team's video demo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLPFBeNlA0arPTrCor3tTg), circa 2017-2019 developed by my research and engineering team. You can see this is a modern version of what I built previously (now using Deep Learning!)
* [Marker less mulitple people tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ivo10gvUo), my student's work, published in ECCV 2020.

### [7. Deep Learning Sydney meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Sydney/) ###
This is one of the largest AI-focused meetup group I founded (together with my co-founder) in 2016. It has close to 4500 members. It is comprised of industry data scientists, scholars, researchers, start-ups and also talent recruiters.

### [8. My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-xu-0221a943/) ###
I am super connected with industry in Australia and internationally. In the past five years, I have interacted with at least 136 companies in ASX200. I have 12,000+ LinkedIn contacts.

### 9. International Collabration and outreach ###
* I had a funded UTS research project, with China/Middle East e-commerce retailer company, [https://www.jollychic.com/](https://www.jollychic.com/), 2018 - 2019
* I visited Singapore in 2019 and met with many [Singaporian business leaders and entrepreneurs]() 

### [10. My Publications](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ykOUWa4AAAAJ&hl=en) ###
* I published at many top international conferences, including AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ECCV, AI-STATS and ICDM 
* I also published at many prestigeous IEEE Transactions: IEEE-(T-NNLS, T-Image Processing, T-Signal Processing, T-KDE, T-Mobile Computing and T-Cybernetics).
* I have co-authored with many world-leading scholars, including [Chair Prof Arnoud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) of Oxford University & DeepMind, [Prof Zoubin Gharamanni](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) of Cambridge University & Chief Scientist of Uber, and [Prof Yike Guo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.guo) of Imperial College of London & Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. 

### [11. My continously updated machine learning notes](https://github.com/roboticcam/machine-learning-notes) ###
Last but definitely not least, my world-famous constantly updated machine learning notes! It has 46 traditional and emerging research topics, and currently has 5000 GitHub stars!  
10% of the materials were recorded in Mandarin-speaking videos in 2015 and became viral.
* [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConITmGn5PFr0hxTI2tWD4Q) has 5500+ subscribers!
