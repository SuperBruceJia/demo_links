Over the past decade and half, I have developed many research and engineering prototypes, demos, notes and projects. They are scattered all over the Web. I organize them in this single repository:

### [1. Cloud demo: ridll.com](http://ridll.com) ###
**RIDLL** is an acronym for **Ri**chard Xu's **D**eep **L**earning **L**ab: This Cloud based demo website has about nine research demos developed by my talented team since 2016. Some notable examples include:  
* [Visualization for What-If scenarios planning for sydney train networks](http://ridll.com/foresight/) click a moving train to bring up a timetable to create a what-if scenario - it also support multi-screen-tasking, completed in 2017 by my team. Note all the displaying data are synthetically generated.
* [Automatic word-completion tool for writing Job Descriptions](http://ridll.com/jobgenerator/) completed in 2016 by my team (it takes about 30 seconds to load)
* [Tool for the shortest maitanaince planning using TSM algorithm](http://ridll.com/activequery/) completed in 2020 by my team
* [Natural Language to SQL Translation](http://ridll.com/nlp2sql/) completed in 2016 by my team

### [2. List of Funded Industry Contractural Research Projects](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YiDa.Xu/grants) ###
This is my official UTS website which shows all the projects that I am the first Chief Investigator since 2015. The funded project names are extracted from the UTS Grants database. My research partners include, *Transport for NSW, Sydney Trains, NSW DFSI, Magellan financial group, CSIRO, Ausgrid, CCH Australia, DSTG, Office of Naval Research, NSW DPI,Food Agility CRC (with Dairy Australia, Coles, USYD, CSU and DataGene)*. In addition, two Australian companies requested not to list the company & project name due to commercial confidence.

### [3. Leadership in 900K Newcrest Mining project](https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2930594/AR08.pdf) ###
This is link to the Charles Sturt University's annual 2008 report, it contains the following paragraph:  
#### *Dr Richard Xu, a lecturer in computer science at the School of Accounting and Computer Science, has begun leading a three-year project to develop a truck-mounted prototype with video camera, sonar and radar to automate a mining process when large rocks jam the rock crusher. The device could prevent costly shutdowns of plant. Newcrest Mines provided $900,000 to fund the project.* ####

I was only a 30-year-old lecturer at the time, and I became responsible for a huge industry research team composed of associate professors!

### [4. World Champion in IEEE Games Conference's Micro-RTS competition](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/competition-results/2019-cog-results) ###
In 2019, my postdoctoral fellow Dr. Jason Traish led a team of my PhD students to win the IEEE Confernece on Game's Micro-RTS competition. Our AI bot, UTS_Imass has a significantly higher win rate compare to the second best team. 
You can visit the official website of IEEE Games Conference [https://ieee-cog.org/2019/competitions_conference/](https://ieee-cog.org/2019/competitions_conference/) then click the "Competition Site" link to browse the above Goolge document in the same way.

### 5. My computer vision Demos in YouTube ###
Between 2006 to 2009, I have built at least a dozen different AI systems based on computer vision at CSU. In addition to being a researcher, I am also an excellent engineer. I built most of these systems myself, including research, coding, purchasing, and even the hard carpentary work of installing the cameras. Please note that I have uploaded these video demos to YouTube at different times. I did not try to centralize them. Here are the links to these video channels:

* [YouTube Demo Channel one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-k-IImevvnN1J6fYhJMA4Q) and [YouTube Demo Channel two](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6U2WWd9xHebIpwCkGDZLkg), circa 2005-2009, contains nine demo systems. note that these two channels have overlaping videos.
* [My TV Interview with Prime TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYnRuWAaw), Prime TV news team came to interview me at CSU to talk about my computer vision work in 2009.

### 6. My student's computer vision Demos in YouTube ###
Fortunately, since 2017, I finally have a laboratory space at UTS to continue computer vision. These are some examples of resume work for my postdoctoral and PhD students:

* [My lab team's video demo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLPFBeNlA0arPTrCor3tTg), circa 2017-2009 developed by my research and engineering team. You can see this is a modern version of what I built previously.
* [Marker less mulitple people tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ivo10gvUo), my student's work, published in ECCV 2020.

### [7. Deep Learning Sydney meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Sydney/) ###
This is one of the largest AI-focused meetup group I founded in 2016. It has close to 4500 members!

### [8. My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-xu-0221a943/) ###
I am super connected with industry in Australia and internationally. In the past five years, I have interacted with at least 136 companies in ASX200. I have 12,000+ LinkedIn contacts.

### [9. My Publications](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ykOUWa4AAAAJ&hl=en) ###
* I published at many top international conferences, including AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ECCV, AI-STATS and ICDM 
* also published at many top IEEE Transactions: IEEE-(T-NNLS, T-Image Processing, T-Signal Processing, T-KDE, T-Mobile Computing and T-Cybernetics).

### [10. My continously updated machine learning notes](https://github.com/roboticcam/machine-learning-notes) ###
Last but definitely not least, my world-famous constantly updated machine learning notes! It currently has 5000 GitHub stars!
